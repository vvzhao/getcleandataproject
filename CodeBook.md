Data Dictionanry ----Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This dataset is originally from Human Activity Recognition Using Samsun Galaxy Smartphones.

Testing and training data sets were first combined into a single data frame.
Measurements containing only the mean and standard deviation of each measurement was extracted.
Descriptive names were assigned to variables and descriptive activity names were assigned to the activities.
Data were then tidied and average of each variable was calculated for activity and each subject.
